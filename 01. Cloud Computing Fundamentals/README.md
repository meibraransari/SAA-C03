## Cloud Computing Fundamentals
### What is Cloud Computing?
Based on the formal definiton from [(NIST)](https://github.com/shamasun/SAA-C03/blob/703d03ef3e8df7f3fa2ee3fd2674d5acecf02d07/01.%20Cloud%20Computing%20Fundamentals/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf). All of them need to be satisfied.

1.  **On-demand self-service**: Provision as needed, without requiring human interaction.
2.  **Broad network access**  : Available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (http, https, ssh, vpn, etc.)
3.  **Resource pooling**      : User has no control or knowledge over exact location of resources **AND** Pooling over several customers using a multi-tenant model.
4.  **Rapid Elasticity**      : Elastic provisioning and released to scale rapidly outward/ inward **AND** To the consumer, capabilities appear unlimited. 
5.  **Measured service**      : Usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and billed.
