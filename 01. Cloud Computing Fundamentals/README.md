## Cloud Computing Fundamentals
### What is Cloud Computing?
Based on the formal definiton from [(NIST)](https://github.com/shamasun/SAA-C03/blob/703d03ef3e8df7f3fa2ee3fd2674d5acecf02d07/01.%20Cloud%20Computing%20Fundamentals/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf). All of them need to be satisfied.

1.  **On-demand self-service** - Capabilities provisioned as needed, without requiring human interaction.
2.  **Broad network access** - Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (http, https, ssh, vpn, etc.)
3.  **Resource pooling** - Sense of location independence (no control or knowledge over exact location of resources) **AND** Resources are pooled over several customers using a multi-tenant model. In other words, characterized by abstraction and economies of scale.
4.  **Rapid Elasticity** - Capabilities elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward/ inward with demand **AND** To the consumer the capabilities appear unlimited. 
5.  **Measured service** - Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and billed.
